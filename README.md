# LOSE
LOSE is Localisation Of Super-flare Event. 
Photometric surveys provide light curves and series of images 
for tens of thousands of stars. Light curve data products
are produced by applying photometric masks to the series of images.
Often, an image with the target star contains faint contaminant stars.
Thus, a flare observed on the light curve of the target star can be 
caused by a background star. Presented here algorithm is developed to 
localize position of the flare applying the PSF-fitting.
